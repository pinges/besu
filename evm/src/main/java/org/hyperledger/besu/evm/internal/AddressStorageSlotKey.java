/**
 * Key to use for lookups in Maps/Sets with an address and storage slot combined as a key.
 *
 * <p>The slot is fully attacker-controlled - e.g. it can be whatever a contract pushes to {@code
 * TSTORE} - so {@link #hashCode()} is a <em>seeded</em> hash, mixing in per-process random values
 * drawn once at class initialisation. Seed randomization is very important as it makes the hash
 * non-deterministic off chain so collisions can only be found out while executing EVM payloads
 * which costs gas.
 *
 * <p>Hashcode is based on multiply-shift universal hashing (Dietzfelbinger) which is efficient
 * enough and has good collision probability for hash tables ({@code <= 2^-32} probability of
 * collision). Even in the case of collisions Java HashMaps treeifies buckets, iff this class
 * implements {@link Comparable} directly, and search goes O(log n) instead of O(n) which limits
 * effects of collisions.
