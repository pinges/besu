# Engine API methods — architecture and how to extend it

This package implements the [Engine API](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/tree/main/src/engine)
(`engine_*` JSON-RPC methods). It follows a strict versioning pattern, described here so that a new
version of a method — or a brand-new method series — is always added the same way. Read this before
changing anything in this package, in the related parameter/result classes, or in their tests.

## Architecture

Each method series (`engine_newPayloadV*`, `engine_getPayloadV*`, `engine_forkchoiceUpdatedV*`, ...)
is a **sealed class hierarchy mirroring the specification**: version N extends version N−1 and
overrides only what its spec version adds or changes.

- Engine methods execute concurrently by default. Engine methods that require ordering (FIFO)
  must extend `OrderedExecutionJsonRpcMethod` — for example `EngineNewPayloadV1`,
  `EngineForkchoiceUpdatedV1`, and their sealed version hierarchies.
- `EngineGetPayloadV1 permits EngineGetPayloadV2`, `... V5 permits EngineGetPayloadV6`, and the
  latest version is `final`. The same applies to the other series.
- All versions extend `ExecutionEngineJsonRpcMethod`, which owns the fork-window validation
  (`minSupportedFork` / `firstUnsupportedFork` constructor arguments, `validateForkSupported`,
  see also `ForkSupportHelper`). Concrete versions never check fork timestamps themselves.
- Each method takes a single `ExecutionEngineJsonRpcMethod.ConstructorArguments` record (built
  via the generated `ConstructorArgumentsBuilder`) plus `(minSupportedFork, firstUnsupportedFork)`,
  instead of a bespoke positional argument list per series — this is what lets `VersionScheduler`
  build every version through one shared factory shape (see below). `ConstructorArguments` only
  carries the fields the series actually need — mark a field `@Nullable` if only some series read
  it (e.g. `mergeCoordinator` is absent for `engine_exchangeTransitionConfigurationV1`) — and
  extend it (and its builder) when adding a series that needs a field it doesn't have yet.
- The JSON data structures are sealed hierarchies too, mirroring the spec versions: request
  parameters in `..internal.parameters` (`ExecutionPayloadV1..V4`,
  `NewPayloadRequestParametersV1..V3`, `ForkchoiceStateV1`, `PayloadAttributesV1..V4`), results in
  `..internal.results` (`PayloadStatusV1`, `ForkchoiceUpdatedResultV1`,
  `EngineGetPayloadResultV1..V6`, `ExecutionPayloadBodiesV1..V2`, `BlobAndProofV1..V2`,
  `BlobsBundleV1/V2`). Result classes reuse the request-side payload hierarchy rather than
  re-declaring header fields: `EngineGetPayloadResultV1` wraps an `ExecutionPayloadV1` via
  `@JsonValue`.
- A version class overrides narrow, protected hooks of its parent (e.g. `createResponse`,
  `createExecutionPayload`, `validateParameters`, `validatePayloadAttributes`) — it never
  re-implements the request flow.

### Registration and scheduling

`org.hyperledger.besu.ethereum.api.jsonrpc.methods.ExecutionEngineJsonRpcMethods` declares, per
series, which version is active in which fork window via the `VersionScheduler` DSL, using
constructor references (not reflection — see `VersionScheduler.EngineMethodFactory`):

```java
VersionScheduler.startsFromBeginningUntil(EngineGetPayloadV1::new, SHANGHAI)
    .thenAlsoFromBeginning(EngineGetPayloadV2::new)
    .thenFrom(CANCUN, EngineGetPayloadV3::new)
    ...
    .thenFrom(AMSTERDAM, EngineGetPayloadV6::new)
    .build(constructorArguments);
```

Not every series is a version-supersedes-version chain: in `engine_getPayloadBodiesBy*` V2 only adds
an optional field, so V1 and V2 coexist permanently, with no fork window on either — use
`VersionScheduler.alwaysActive(EngineGetPayloadBodiesByHashV1::new, EngineGetPayloadBodiesByHashV2::new)`
for series like this instead of `startsFromBeginningUntil`/`thenFrom`. Two versions can also share
one fork window inside a chain — `thenFrom` takes varargs, which is how `engine_getBlobsV2` and
`engine_getBlobsV3` (both introduced at Osaka, neither superseding the other) are scheduled:

```java
VersionScheduler.startsFromBeginningUntil(EngineGetBlobsV1::new, OSAKA)
    .thenFrom(OSAKA, EngineGetBlobsV2::new, EngineGetBlobsV3::new)
    .build(constructorArguments);
```

`VersionScheduler.startsFrom(<FORK>, EngineBarV1::new)` is the entry point for a **brand-new series
with no earlier version**: one factory, active from `<FORK>` onward, with no upper bound, registered
as its own independent chain. Use it instead of appending `.thenFrom(<FORK>, ...)` to an existing
chain whenever the new method does not supersede that chain's current version — `thenFrom` closes
the previous window at `<FORK>`, which would wrongly retire methods that stay valid.

`engine_getBlobsV4` is exactly that case: despite looking like "the version after V3", it takes
different request parameters (`versioned_blob_hashes` plus a new `indices_bitarray`), returns
`BlobCellsAndProofsV1` rather than `BlobAndProofV1`/`V2`, and does not extend `EngineGetBlobsV3`.
It is an *addition* alongside V2/V3, which remain valid indefinitely, so it gets its own scheduler.
Its specification has no fork activation condition, so it is served from Osaka on, where cell
proofs are introduced, and answers `null` before that instead of an unsupported fork error:

```java
VersionScheduler.startsFrom(OSAKA, EngineGetBlobsV4::new).build(constructorArguments);
```

The scheduler instantiates each version with the right `(minSupportedFork, firstUnsupportedFork)`
pair derived from the chain. It builds **every** version, whether or not the protocol schedule of
the network contains its forks: the set of registered engine methods is the same on every network,
and the fork rules are enforced on each call instead (see `ForkSupportHelper`):

- a call that carries a timestamp outside the fork window of the method (a payload, payload
  attributes, or a built payload that is found) is answered with `-38005: Unsupported fork`;
- `engine_getBlobsV2`, `V3` and `V4` answer `null` before Osaka, their specifications have no
  unsupported fork error;
- a call that needs no fork check, such as `engine_forkchoiceUpdatedV4` without payload attributes,
  succeeds.

Do not make registration depend on the fork schedule — a consensus client picks method versions
from the capability list, and the last case must work on a network that has not scheduled the fork
yet.

Method names live in the `RpcMethod` enum. `engine_exchangeCapabilities` advertises exactly the
methods registered in `ExecutionEngineJsonRpcMethods`, so there is no separate capabilities list to
maintain and no advertised method answers with `-32604: Method not enabled`. A method that the node
is unable to serve for a reason other than its fork is therefore not registered at all:
`engine_newPayloadWithWitnessV5` is left out on a node without a path-based (Bonsai) world state.

## Test pattern (src/test, same package)

Tests are layered exactly like the production classes: `EngineGetPayloadV6Test extends
EngineGetPayloadV5Test extends ... V1Test`, so **every version class runs all the tests of the
previous versions plus its own**.

- The V1 test class owns the generic scenarios, written against protected hooks:
  `createMethodInstance()`, `getMinSupportedTimestamp()` / `getMaxSupportedTimestamp()`,
  payload/attribute builders, fixture customizers, and result-assertion hooks such as
  `assertPayloadResult(Object)` that each version extends with
  `super.assertPayloadResult(result); ...` plus its own checks.
- A version test class contains only: the `createMethodInstance()` override, the method-name test
  override, hook overrides, and tests for behavior introduced in that version.
- A scenario that stops applying at some version is guarded with
  `assumeTrue(someCapabilityHook())` on a boolean/Optional hook the later version overrides —
  **never** `@Disabled` and never an empty test override.
- Fork milestones in unit tests are the fake ones defined by `AbstractScheduledApiTest`
  (Paris=10, Shanghai=20, Cancun=30, Prague=50, Osaka=60, Amsterdam=70, ...).

Acceptance tests are fixture-driven, one directory per fork:
`acceptance-tests/tests/src/acceptanceTest/resources/jsonrpc/engine/<fork>/` containing a
`genesis.json` and `test-cases/` with JSON request/response pairs (see also the
`*AcceptanceTestHelper` classes under `acceptance-tests/.../acceptance/ethereum/`).

## Checklist: add version N+1 to an existing series

Use the commits that introduced the current latest version as the exemplar
(`git log --oneline -- <path to latest version class>`), then:

1. Un-`final` (or extend `permits`) the current latest method class; add
   `EngineFooVN+1 extends EngineFooVN` (`final`), overriding `getName()` and only the hooks the
   spec changes. The compiler enforces the rest of the chain.
2. If the payload/attributes/result shape changes, extend the corresponding sealed hierarchy in
   `..internal.parameters` / `..internal.results` the same way (update `permits` on the parent).
3. Add `ENGINE_FOO_VN+1("engine_fooVN+1")` to `RpcMethod`.
4. Extend the series' `VersionScheduler` chain in `ExecutionEngineJsonRpcMethods` with
   `.thenFrom(<ACTIVATION_FORK>, EngineFooVN+1::new)` (this also advertises it via
   `engine_exchangeCapabilities`). Only do this if VN+1 really supersedes VN;
   if the "next version" is unrelated in request/response shape it belongs in its own chain via
   `startsFrom(...)` — see `engine_getBlobsV4` under "Registration and scheduling".
5. Add `EngineFooVN+1Test extends EngineFooVNTest`: override `createMethodInstance()`, the
   method-name test, the fork-window hooks, and any builder/assertion hooks; add tests only for
   the new behavior. All inherited tests must pass unmodified.
6. Add/extend the acceptance-test fixtures for the activation fork.
7. Update `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Checklist: add a brand-new method series

1. Create `EngineBarV1 extends ExecutionEngineJsonRpcMethod` (sealed once V2 exists), passing the
   fork window to the super constructor; add its parameter/result classes as (future-sealed)
   hierarchies from the start.
2. Register it in `RpcMethod` and in `ExecutionEngineJsonRpcMethods` via `VersionScheduler`
   (`startsFrom(<FORK>, EngineBarV1::new)` or `alwaysActive(...)`).
3. Create `EngineBarV1Test` with all scenarios written against protected hooks from day one, so
   `EngineBarV2Test` can be layered on top later.
4. Add acceptance-test fixtures and a `CHANGELOG.md` entry.

## Definition of done

```
./gradlew :ethereum:api:test --tests "org.hyperledger.besu.ethereum.api.jsonrpc.internal.methods.engine.*"
./gradlew :ethereum:api:spotlessApply
```

Both must pass, with no `@Disabled` tests introduced, before the change is complete.
